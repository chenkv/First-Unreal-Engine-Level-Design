My first Unreal Engine level design with just basic free assets from the Unreal Engine store.
I know there's glitching textures on the walls, out of place lights that are way too bright,
and walls that aren't tall enough for the door. It's just a concept, where the path behind
is blocked by falling rubble and there's only a path forward towards a humongous door.
